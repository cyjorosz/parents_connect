# Parents Connect 

Parents Connect is a Ruby on Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates). It was created by an enthusiastic group of [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) students for their final project. The website was created to help parents meet other parents and see what family friendly events are taking place in their neighbourhood.
